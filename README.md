Hi this is a test with The Movie DB

just clone repo, then run

`yarn && yarn start`

In this project used React's Hooks, Redux, redux-sagas and reselect for selectors.

You can sort the movies in the list either by Popularity or by the more recently released.

Clicking on a movie in the list will take you to its details page.

From the movie detail page, you can also add it to your list of favourites that you might want to see later.

Enjoy!
